# gym-retro-ai-preset-with-flaws-master
ABOUT THIS REPO: This GitHub repo is for debugging purposes. I am not the original developer of the Sonic3.py and config-feedforward files, but I did modify them slightly. I don't really understand Python, so I don't know what I'm downg wrong.

What I want to happen: Even though it may use more resources, I would like the AI to see each frame in full size, with full color. This will make it easy for the AI to see some things, such as rocks. It has a terrible problem with rocks in Sonic 3.

What's happening: It uses the original resolution divided by 8 with grayscale. This can make it hard to see most things, such as rocks and slopes. I also can't configure it to play Sega Master System games, such as Sonic 1 SMS.
